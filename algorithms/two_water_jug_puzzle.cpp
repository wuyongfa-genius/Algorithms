/*The Two Water Jug Puzzle
Difficulty Level : Hard
You are on the side of the river. You are given a m liter jug and a n liter jug where 0 < m < n. 
Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. 
You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of
operations to be performed to obtain d liters of water in one of jug. 
The operations you can perform are: 
a)Empty a Jug
b)Fill a Jug
c)Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.*/

// C++ program to count minimum number of steps
// required to measure d litres water using jugs
// of m liters and n liters capacity.

// Utility function to return GCD of 'a'
// and 'b'.
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
